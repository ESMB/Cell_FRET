Code for analysing protein oligomers in cells. The code requires .tif images of
the donor channel, acceptor channel, and directly excited acceptor channel. 

Images are thresholded, and individual puncta are selected based on the directly excited 
acceptor channel. The FRET efficiency of these are binned and fit to Gaussian distributions.
